answers possible.\_Google's algorithms look for signals\nand indications as to whether a website is consistent with the user search term\nand whether it can provide a great user experience.\n\nA practical and attractive online store design can\ninclude\_online store\_SEO\_factors\_based on which Google\ndecides what ranking to consider for that website.\_The placement of\nkeywords along the web page is also very important.\_\n\nGoogle reviews and evaluates the features of the website in\nquestion, including\_internal\_linking, signals that indicate there is\na good search on the\_website, as well as user behavioral signals such as\nwebsite clicks and personalized options, and so on.\n\nResult\n\nBuilding and designing a website is a very difficult and\nchallenging task
